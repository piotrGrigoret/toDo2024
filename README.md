### Description:

This application is a simple and convenient to-do list designed to help users organize their daily tasks. Users can enter their name and receive a personalized greeting, adding a welcoming touch. The app features a minimalist and stylish interface, allowing users to add task titles and descriptions. It also includes filters to display active and completed tasks, as well as a function to clear completed tasks, helping users keep their task list organized.

Notably, the application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience on different screen sizes. This app is purely a frontend solution â€” all data is stored locally on the user's device and is not saved in a database, ensuring information is retained only as long as the app remains open or until the page is refreshed.
